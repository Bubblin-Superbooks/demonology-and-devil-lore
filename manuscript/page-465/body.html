<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Infinite longing, wondrous sorrow,</p><p>Steal through my heart,—</p><p>My heart as yet scarce healed;</p><p>It seems as though its wounds, forgotten,</p><p>By loving lips again were kissed,</p><p>And once again were bleeding</p><p>Drops of burning crimson,</p><p>Which long and slowly trickle down</p><p>Upon an ancient house below there</p><p>In the deep, deep sea-town,</p><p>On an ancient, high-roofed, curious house,</p><p>Where, lone and melancholy,</p><p>Below by the window a maiden sits,</p><p>Her head on her arm reclined,—</p><p>Like a poor and uncared-for child;</p><p>And I know thee, thou poor and long-sorrowing child!</p><p>...
