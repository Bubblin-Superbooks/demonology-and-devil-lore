Didron Finds This Confirmed In The Legends Of Every Country, And Especially Refers To A Story Of St. Dunstan, Archbishop Of Canterbury, In The Tenth Century. Three Men, Convicted Of Coining False Money, Had Been Condemned To Death. Immediately Before The Celebration Of Mass On The Day Of Pentecost, The Festival Of The Holy Ghost, St. Dunstan Inquired Whether Justice Had Been Done Upon The Three Criminals: He Was Informed In Reply That The Execution Had Been Delayed On Account Of The Solemn Feast Of Pentecost Then In Celebration. ‘It Shall Not Be Thus,’ Cried The Indignant Archbishop, And Gave Orders For The Immediate Execution Of The Guilty Men. Several Of Those Who Were Present Remonstrated Against The Cruelty Of That Order; It Was Nevertheless Obeyed.</h4></div> </div>
