Like Lilith, Lamia was robbed of her children, and was driven by despair to avenge herself on all children.The name of Lamia was long used to frighten Italian children, as that of Lilith was by Hebrew nurses.</p><p>It is possible that the part assigned to Lilith in the temptation of Eve may have been suggested by ancient Egyptian sculptures, which represent the Tree of Life in Amenti (Paradise) guarded by the Serpent-goddess Nu. One of these in the British Museum represents the Osirian on his journey to heaven, and his soul in form of a human-headed bird, drinking the water of Life as poured out to them from a jar by the goddess who coils around the sacred sycamore, her womanâ€™s bust and face appearing amid the branches much like Lilith in our old pictures.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">The Singhalese also have a kind of Lilith or Lamia</p></div> </div>
