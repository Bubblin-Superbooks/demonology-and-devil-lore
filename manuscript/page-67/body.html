The Mussulman calls the Yezedi a Satan-worshipper only as the early Zoroastrian held the worshipper of a <em>deva</em> to be the same. The chief object of worship among the Yezedis is the figure of the bird <em>Taous</em>, a half-mythical peacock. Professor King of Cambridge traces the <em>Taous</em> of this Assyrian sect to the “sacred bird called a phœnix,” whose picture, as seen by Herodotus (ii. 73) in Egypt, is described by him as ‘very like an eagle in outline and in size, but with plumage partly gold-coloured, partly crimson,’ and which was said to return to Heliopolis every five hundred years, there to burn itself on the altar of the Sun, that another might rise from its ashes.Now the name Yezedis is simply Izeds, genii; and we are thus pointed to Arabia, where we find the belief in genii is strongest, and also associated with the mythical bird <em>Rokh</em> of its folklore. There we find Mohammed rebuking the popular belief</p></div> </div>
