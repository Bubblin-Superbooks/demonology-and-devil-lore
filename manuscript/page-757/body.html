Woe henceforth to any gods suspected of taking sides with the dragon in this man’s life-and-death struggle with the ferocities of nature, and with his own terrors reflected from them! The legend of Prometheus was their unconsciously-given ‘notice to quit,’ though it waited many centuries for its great interpreter. It is Goethe who alone has seen how pale and weak grow Jove’s fireworks before the thought-thunderbolts of the artist, launched far beyond the limitations that chain him in nature. Gods are even yet going down in many lands before the sublime sentence of Prometheus:—</p><p>Curtain thy heavens, thou Jove, with clouds and mist,</p><p>And, like a boy that moweth thistles down,</p><p>Unloose thy spleen on oaks and mountain-tops;</p><p>Yet canst thou not deprive me of my earth,</p><p>Nor of my hut, the which thou didst not build,</p></div> </div>
