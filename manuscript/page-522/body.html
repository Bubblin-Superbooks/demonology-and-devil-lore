The latter word is known in the south of France also, and gave its name to the town Tarascon. The legend is that an amphibious monster haunted the Rhone, preventing navigation and committing terrible ravages, until sixteen of the boldest inhabitants of the district resolved to encounter it. Eight lost their lives, but the others, having destroyed the monster, founded the town of Tarascon, where the ‘Fête de la tarasque’ is still kept up.Calmet, Sedley, and others, however, believe that <em>teraphim</em> is merely a modification of seraphim, and the Tefila, or phylacteries, of the same origin.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">The phylactery was tied into a knot.
