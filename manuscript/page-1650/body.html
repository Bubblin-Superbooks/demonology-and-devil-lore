<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>With the picture of Dives and Lazarus presented elsewhere () may be instructively compared the accompanying scene of a rich man’s death-bed (), taken from ‘Ars Moriendi,’ one of the early block-books. This picture is very remarkable from the suggestion it contains of an opposition between a devil on the dying man’s right and the hideous dragon on his left. While the dragon holds up a scroll, bidding him think of his treasure (<em>Yntende thesauro</em>), the Devil suggests provision for his friends (<em>Provideas amicis</em>). This devil seems to be a representative of the rich man’s relatives who stand near, and appears to be supported by his ugly superior, who points towards hell as the penalty of not making such provision as is suggested. There would appear to be in this picture a vague distinction between the mere bestial fiend who tempts, and the ugly but good-natured devil who punishes, and whom rich sinners cannot escape by bequests to churches.</p></div> </div>
