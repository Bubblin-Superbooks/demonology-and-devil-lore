When Tiamat the Dragon, or the Leviathan, opens ‘the fountains of the great deep,’ and Anu ‘the windows of Heaven,’ it is Hea or Noah who saves the life of man. M. François Lenormant has shown this to be the probable sense of one of the most ancient Accadian fragments in the British Museum. In it allusion is made to ‘the serpent of seven heads ... that beats the sea.’Hea, however, appears to be more clearly indicated in a fragment which Professor Sayce appends to this:—</p><p>Below in the abyss the forceful multitudes may they sacrifice.</p><p>The overwhelming fear of Anu in the midst of Heaven <em>encircles</em> his path.</p><p>The spirits of earth, the mighty gods, withstand him not.</p><p>The king like a lightning-flash opened.</p></div> </div>
