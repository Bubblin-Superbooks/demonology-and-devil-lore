<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The Zoroastrian conversion of <em>deva</em> (deus) into <em>devil</em> does not alone represent the work of this <em>odium theologicum</em>. In the early hymns of India the appellation <em>asuras</em> is given to the gods. Asura means a spirit. But in the process of time <em>asura</em>, like dæmon, came to have a sinister meaning: the gods were called <em>suras</em>, the demons <em>asuras</em>, and these were said to contend together. But in Persia the <em>asuras_—demonised in India—retained their divinity, and gave the name _ahura</em> to the supreme deity, Ormuzd (Ahura-mazda). On the other hand, as Mr. Muir supposes, <em>Varenya</em>, applied to evil spirits of darkness in the Zendavesta, is cognate with Varuna (Heaven); and the Vedic Indra, king of the gods—the Sun—is named in the Zoroastrian religion as one of the chief councillors of that Prince of Darkness.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">But in every country conquered by a new religion, there will always be found some, as we have seen, who will hold on to the old deity under all his changed</p></div> </div>
