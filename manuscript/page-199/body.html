Do Thou, Removing The Evil Which Cometh From The Gods, O Bounteous Giver, Have Mercy Upon Me.</h5><h5>To The Tawny, The Fair-complexioned Dispenser Of Bounties, I Send Forth A Great And Beautiful Song Of Praise; Adore The Radiant God With Prostrations; We Hymn The Illustrious Name Of Rudra.</h5><h5>Sturdy-limbed, Many-shaped, Fierce, Tawny, He Hath Decked Himself With Brilliant Ornaments Of Gold; Truly Strength Is Inseparable From Rudra, The Sovereign Of This Vast World.</h5><h5 class="  ">Worthy Of Worship, Thou Bearest The Arrows</h5></div> </div>
