<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h4>M. François Lenormant Has Written An Extremely Instructive Chapter In Comparison Of The Accadian And The Finnish Mythologies. He There Shows That They Are As One And The Same Tree, Adapted To Antagonistic Climates.with Similar Triad, Runes, Charms, And Even Names In Some Cases, Their Regard For The Fire Worshipped By Both Varies In A Way That Seems At First Glance Somewhat Anomalous. The Accadians In Their Fire-worship Exhausted The Resources Of Praise In Ascription Of Glory And Power To The Flames; The Finns In Their Cold Home Celebrated The Fire Festival At The Winter Solstice, Uttered Invocations Over The Fire, And The Mother Of The Family, With Her Domestic Libation, Said: ‘Always Rise So High, O My Flame, But Burn Not Larger Nor More Ardent!’ This Diminution Of Enthusiasm In The Northern Fire-worshipper, As Compared With The Southern, May Only Be The Result Of Euphemism In The Latter; Or Perhaps While The Formidable Character Of The Fire-god Among The Primitive Assyrians Is Indicated In The Utter Prostration Before Him Characteristic Of Their Litanies And Invocations, In The Case Of The Finns The Perpetual Presence Of The More Potent Cold Led To The Less Excessive Adoration. These Ventured To Recognise The Faults Of Fire.</h4></div> </div>
